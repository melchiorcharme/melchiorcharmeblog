          This entry is a promise to stop drifting and start <strong>designing</strong> the life I actually want to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, it has become obvious that “being productive” is not about squeezing more tasks into the day.
          It is about choosing fewer, more honest priorities and showing up for them consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intent behind this blog is simple: write in public to keep myself accountable, notice what truly
          matters to me, and deliberately make room for it in my schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time these posts should become a record of experiments in focus, discipline, and building a life
          that feels self-directed rather than reactive.
